# HealthBehaviorInsights

## Dataset Overview 
For this project, we have used the Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity - Behavioral 
Risk Factor Surveillance System dataset, which contains comprehensive information 
about health-related behaviors among adults, including diet, physical activity, and 
weight status. The dataset includes multiple behavioral and demographic features that 
will serve as inputs to the model, with specific health outcomes as the target variables to 
predict and classify. 

● Source: The dataset is sourced from data.gov, part of the Behavioral Risk Factor 
Surveillance System (BRFSS) managed by the CDC. This is a reputable, publicly 
available source often used for academic and research purposes in public health 
studies. 

● Type: The dataset is structured, consisting of rows and columns, with each row 
representing an individual survey response and each column representing a 
specific health-related or demographic feature. 

● Size: The dataset includes 104271 rows and 33 columns, representing a 
comprehensive dataset on health behaviors.
